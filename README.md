# manhunt
Manhunt plugin made in spigot for Minecraft
I made this plugin for the Dream fans that want to experience the manhunt gamemode!
This is the source code for the plugin, you can download it in spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/manhunt-plugin.92337/
To run the plugin you'll need a 1.16 server, although I haven't tested it in lower versions.
Have fun!
